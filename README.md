ptag
====

PerlTAG is an easy way to tag your MP3. That's all... I just wanted to learn a bit of Moose, and to "beautify" what I did in ruby some time ago.



Libraries Required
==================


MP3::Tag & Moose, they can be installed like this

perl -MCPAN -e "CPAN::Shell->notest('install', 'MP3::Tag', 'Moose')"
